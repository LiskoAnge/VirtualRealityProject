# VirtualRealityProject
 Virtual Reality educative project about the Solar System. The main scene consists in two portals, where the user can use to travel to two different scenes; a game and a big area where the user can explore around.. In the game scene, the user needs to position the planets of the Solar System depending on their distance from the sun. The sun will be already present in the scene in its correct location. In the other scene the planets are much bigger, the user can move around teleporting from a planet to another one, observing their different rotations. The user can also grab some asteroids and throw them around, for some additional fun to the scene.
